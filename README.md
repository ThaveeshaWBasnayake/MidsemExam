The Signals &amp; Sensor Design Mid-Semester Assignment - Created by Thaveesha W Basnayake

This project will entail a MATLAB program which will perform the following 3 tasks. It will ask the user for an input for the type of operation - shifting, scaling or reversing - for the type of signal that needs to be created, either discrete or continuous and the amount of shift which can either be a negative or positive value. 

The following assumptions will be made for the outcome of this task:
- The amount of shift, scaling or reversing can be either + or -
- An exception should be thrown in case the user inputs an unrealistic value

The outcome of this project should include the following:
- 4 different signals
- One signal must be a sinosoidal wave either sine or cosine
- One must be a SAW tooth or Square
- The other two graphs can be of the programmers choice
- Those who implement the system using AppDesigner will gain extra points
